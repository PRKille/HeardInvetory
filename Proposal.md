#### Heard! Kitchen Inventory and Pricing System

##### Description
Heard! is the next generation of restaurant inventory and pricing systems. Designed with the kitchen in mind, it will make short work of pricing from delivery to plate or bottle to glass.

##### Use Case
Small, chef-owned restaurants with a seasonal menu are going to get the most use out of this intuitive, yet powerful, planning, and success application.
Initial onboarding and new product intake will consist of a minor breakdown of price/weight and volume in the user's preferred form of measurement. The application will handle all other breakdowns from full case to teaspoon.
Once the inventory has been established simply creating prep items, adding ingredients, and giving final amounts in number, weight, or volume will return pricing for the given type or types of measurement needed.
Finally, plate pricing will be a snap by adding in quantities from the prep item categories and giving the preferred food cost percentage.
